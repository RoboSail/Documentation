Curriculum & Teaching Plans
===========================


Goals of the course
-------------------

1. Use new skills in programming, electronics, mechanisms, and design.
2. Think at a high level and create algorithms that translate sailing knowledge into code for a robot
3. Sail a robotic sailboat using scientific sailing principles
4. See connections to real-life robotics problems such as unmanned vehicles in challenging environments.
5. Enjoy your time in the course and in working as an engineer and developing a variety of engineering skills
6. Be inspired to explore technical subjects and Engineering fields


Technical Concepts you will learn
---------------------------------

1.  Program in C in an Arduino development environment,
    1. have good programming style,
    2. use functions, logic, and variables appropriately
    3. research commands as needed,
2.  Use servo motors, both remote control and computer-controlled
3.  Use a variety of sensors and interface them with computer
4.  Translate your knowledge of sailing into algorithms for a computer
    1. Points of sail (POS) with correct sail trim
    2. Maneuvers: head up, bear off, tack, gybe, get out of irons, beat, run
5.   Code your algorithms for an autonomous sailboat
6.   Understand basic robotics – “Sense, think, act”


Community Boating RoboSail Course Teaching Plans
-------------------------------------------------

Period | Objective
-------|-----------
Intro  |Introduction and Course Goals
Day 1  | Objective: Know each other and the plan for the course. Sail the boats RC and think how you can do it in code. Characterize boats. Think what information you need to be able to teach a robot boat to sail. Do robot sailing exercises. Get personal computers ready to program Arduinos.
Day 2  | Objectives: get started on Arduinos. Investigate data from WindVane and how to send RC commands thru the Arduino. Generate algorithms for simple sailing maneuvers.
Day 3  | Objective: Define frame of reference for sensor data. Develop algorithms/code for basic sailing maneuvers. Continue learning how to program on Arduinos. Write code to control servos from WindVane and test it out on water.
Day 4  | Objective: Brainstorm and Develop algorithms/code for basic sailing maneuvers. Continue learning how to program on Arduinos. Write/test/debug code for autonomous sailing of simple maneuvers.
Day 5  | Objective: Develop algorithms/code for more sailing maneuvers. Implement on Arduino and practice coding skills. Discuss data available from other sensors (Compass and GPS) and values that can be calculated from this data.
Day 6  | Objective: Final Regatta! Use GPS code
